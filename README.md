# wedding-invitation

Built for my own personal use, this is a one-page, static website with **bilingual** support; the content can be displayed either in English or in Hungarian.

## Content 

It is built with vanilla CSS, and a mixture of vanilla JavaScript and jQuery. I used Foundation (https://foundation.zurb.com/) for normalizing purposes, and because I wanted to try it. 

Hungarian-friendly Google Fonts used. 

## Use 

### Beginner-friendly 
As a newbie myself, this site can be most appropriate for you if **you're a beginner.** 
All the solutions are simple, code sources are marked in comments, so if you've just finished a HTML+CSS tutorial, this will be relatively clear already. 
So just feel free to fork it and use it the way you'd like, could be a good learning curve. 

**Contributions** are welcome too, as a learning project, this site is likely to be clumsy here and there.
